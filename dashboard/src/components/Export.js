            This tool produces a zip file containing the following:
            <ul>
                <li>a JSON file containing an array of submission metadata called <strong><code>submissions.json</code></strong>; and</li>
                <li>WAV files of patients' audio submissions named <strong><code>submission_ID.wav</code></strong>, where
                    <ul>
                        <li>"ID" is the identifier of a submission detailed in <code>submissions.json</code>, and</li>
                        <li>Each audio file is encoded as a 16kHz 16-bit signed integer PCM WAV file.</li>

            As an example, an exported zip file of a single submission may contain an <code>submission_1.wav</code> audio file and a <code>submissions.json</code> file with the following contents:

            While JSON is a useful, human-readable format for analysing the submission data further programmatically, you may wish to inspect the data using Excel. To ingest the submissions.json file into Excel, follow these steps:
